** Pseudo-code: **

1. Initialize an adjacency list `adj` to store the graph connections.
2. Create a boolean array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes.
3. Initialize a variable `max` to store the maximum count of nodes in a connected component.
4. Iterate through each node from 1 to `n`.
5. If the current node has not been visited:
   - Set a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - Call the `DFS` method to perform a depth-first search on the connected component starting from the current node.
   - Update `max` with the maximum value between `max` and `cnt`.
6. If `max` is 1, return -1 as there are no connected components.
7. Return the prime number at index `max-1` from the `primes` list.

**Code Execution Summary:**

1. The code defines a class `Complete` with static variables `cnt` and `primes` (an ArrayList to store prime numbers).
2. The `helpSanta` method takes inputs `n` (number of nodes), `m` (number of edges), and a 2D array `g` representing the graph connections.
3. The method initializes an adjacency list `adj` to store the graph connections.
4. It builds the adjacency list `adj` based on the provided graph connections `g`.
5. It initializes a boolean array `vis` to keep track of visited nodes.
6. It initializes a variable `max` to 0 to store the maximum count of nodes in a connected component.
7. It iterates through each node from 1 to `n`.
8. If the current node has not been visited:
   - Sets the counter `cnt` to 0.
   - Calls the `DFS` method to perform a depth-first search on the connected component starting from the current node.
   - Updates `max` with the maximum value between `max` and `cnt`.
9. If `max` is 1, the method returns -1 as there are no connected components.
10. It returns the prime number at index `max-2` from the `primes` list.
11. The `DFS` method performs a depth-first search on the connected component starting from a given node `s`.
12. It marks the node `s` as visited, increments the counter `cnt`, and recursively calls `DFS` on the adjacent unvisited nodes.
13. The `precompute` method initializes the `primes` list with prime numbers up to 1,000,000.
14. The code assumes that the `precompute` method is called before using the `primes` list.

This summary provides an overview of the code's functionality and structure. Executing the code will require calling the `helpSanta` method with appropriate arguments and handling the returned result accordingly.
